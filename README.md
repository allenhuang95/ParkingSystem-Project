# ParkingSystem-Project

Toronto has 7500 single space parking meters, collecting fees from these meters one by one manually can be painful and time-consuming.
In order to make the whole process easier, I designed and implemented the GUI application Haolun’s Parking Helper.
This application employs MVC design pattern and provide multiple useful functions for Customers, Parking Enforcers and Admin.
With the help of Haolun’s Parking Helper:  
•	Paying manually at parking meters is no longer required, customers can pay easily with this app in the car.
•	Checking parking space status with eyes is no longer required, parking enforcers can check the space’s status online with only a few clicks.
•	Collecting fees from parking meters one by one manually is no longer required, all fees paid through the app will be sent to business account automatically. Admin can verify all payment status easily.
•	Putting something on the space to mark it disabled is no longer required, parking enforcer can disable/enable the parking space online with a few clicks.
